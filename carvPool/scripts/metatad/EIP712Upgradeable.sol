The encoding specified in the EIP is very generic, and such a generic implementation in Solidity is not feasible, thus this contract does not implement the encoding itself. Protocols need to implement the type-specific encoding they need in their contracts using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`. This contract implements the EIP 712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA ({_hashTypedDataV4}). The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain. NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as \"v4\", as implemented by the JSON RPC method https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html[`eth_signTypedDataV4` in MetaMask]. NOTE: In the upgradeable version of this contract, the cached values will correspond to the address, and the domain separator of the implementation contract. This will cause the `_domainSeparatorV4` function to always rebuild the separator from the immutable values, which is cheaper than accessing a cached version in cold storage. _Available since v3.4._","events":{"EIP712DomainChanged()":{"details":"MAY be emitted to signal that the domain could have changed."},"Initialized(uint8)":{"details":"Triggered when the contract has been initialized or reinitialized."}},"kind":"dev","methods":{"eip712Domain()":{"details":"See {EIP-5267}. _Available since v4.9._"}},"stateVariables":{"__gap":{"details":"This empty reserved space is put in place to allow future versions to add new variables without shifting down storage in the inheritance chain.
